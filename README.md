# Bitcoin Analysis and Visualization with Plotly, Price Prediction with LSTM model
\* In order to see fully rendered visualizations by Plotly in jupyter notebook, please visit [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AsunaMasuda/Bitcoin_plotly_keras/tree/master/Bitcoin%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization%20with%20Plotly,%20Price%20Prediction%20with%20Keras.ipynb) on jupyter nbviewer. (ipython files in Github repository cannot show visualizations by plotly.)

## Overview
This notebook focuses on these two aspects below, mainly for the writer's self-learning purpose:

- Data clearning and analysis with Python libraries and Bitcoin price prediction by deep learning algolism called LSTM with Keras
- Interactive Data visualizations with Plotly


## Reference
To create this notebook, 
<br>For data visualization with Plotly:
<br>I refered to [a Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/plotly-tutorial-for-beginners) by [DATAI](https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1) and Plotly [official document](https://plot.ly/python/).
<br>For price prediction with LSRM by Keras:
<br>I refered to [a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dashee87/blogScripts/blob/master/Jupyter/2017-11-20-predicting-cryptocurrency-prices-with-deep-learning.ipynb) which explained an applicaiton of deep learning to Bitcoin/Etherium price prediction by a data scientist [David Sheeran](https://dashee87.github.io/about/).
